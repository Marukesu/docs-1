# Launchers

Applications can show additional information in the dock as well as the application menu. This makes the application feel more integrated into the system and give user it's status at a glance. See [HIG for Dock integration](https://elementary.io/docs/human-interface-guidelines#dock-integration) for what you should do and what you shouldn't.

For this integration you can use the [Granite.Serivces.Application API](https://valadoc.org/granite/Granite.Services.Application.html). Since it uses the [Unity's Launcher API](https://valadoc.org/unity/Unity.LauncherEntry.html) dbus path, the API can work accross many different distributions as it is widely supported by third party applications.

#### Current API support:

| Service | Badge Counter | Progress Bar | Static Quicklist |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Application menu | Yes | No | Yes |
| Dock | Yes | Yes | Yes |

## Setting Up

Before writing the code, you must first install the `granite` library, you can do it by executing the following command in Terminal:

```bash
sudo apt install libgranite-dev
```

Now let's add the Granite library to your build system. Open your meson.build file and add the new dependency to the `executable` method.

```text
executable(
    meson.project_name(),
    'src/Application.vala',
    dependencies: [
        dependency('gtk+-3.0'),
        dependency('granite', version: '>=5.2.4') # 5.2.4 is the first release to support the API
    ],
    install: true
)
```

Though we haven't made any changes to our source code yet, change into your build directory and run `ninja` to build your project. It should still build without any errors. If you do encounter errors, double check your changes and resolve them before continuing.

## Using the API

Once you've set up `granite` in your build system it's time to write some code.

The first thing you'll need to use the API is set your application desktop ID. This is usually the filename of your application entry that is installed in the `/usr/share/applications` directory like: `com.github.username.application.desktop`. Keep in mind that if you're generating the desktop file with a build system, the **desktop ID is the final basename of the file generated by your build system** and not a string ending with `.in` or any other type of extension. you can do it by setting the `application_id` property of you application class.

since the application have an properly desktop ID defined, Granite will get it automatically.
The functions are statics so there is no problem accessing trey.

Showing a `12` number in the badge is as easy as:

```csharp
Granite.Services.Application.set_badge_visible.begin (true);
Granite.Services.Application.set_badge.begin (12);
```

Keep in mind you have to set the `set_badge_visible` property to true, and use an int64 type for the `set_badge` property.

The same goes for showing a progress bar, here we show a progress bar showing 20% progress:

```csharp
Granite.Services.Application.set_progress_visible.begin (true);
Granite.Services.Application.set_progress.begin (0.2f);
```

As you can see the type of `set_progress` property is `double` and is a range between `0` and `1`: from 0% to 100%.
Since they are async functions, you need to suffix them with `.begin`.

## Static Quicklists

Static quicklists do not involve writing any code or using any external dependencies.

Static quicklists are stored within your `.desktop` file. These are so called "actions". You can define many actions in your desktop file that will always show as an action in the application menu as well as in the dock.

The format is as follows:

```text
[Desktop Action ActionID]
Name=The name of the action
Icon=The icon of the action (optional)
Exec=The path to application executable and it's command line arguments (optional)
```

Let's take a look at an example of an action that will open a new window of your application:

```text
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Application name
Exec=application-executable
...

[Desktop Action NewWindow]
Name=New Window
Exec=application-executable -n
```

Note that adding `-n` or any other argument will not make your application magically open a new window. It is up to your application to handle and interpret command line arguments. The [GLib.Application API](https://valadoc.org/gio-2.0/GLib.Application.html) provides many examples and an extensive documentation on how to handle these arguments, particularly the [command\_line signal](https://valadoc.org/gio-2.0/GLib.Application.command_line.html).

Please take a look at a [freedesktop.org Additional applications actions section](https://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/ar01s10.html) for a detailed description of what keys are supported and what they do.
